+PPTP	The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is an obsolete method for implementing virtual private networks, with many known security issues. PPTP uses a control channel over TCP and a GRE tunnel operating to encapsulate PPP packets.
+UART	Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter. A computer hardware device for asynchronous serial communication in which the data format and transmission speeds are configurable. The electric signaling levels and methods (such as differential signaling, etc.) are handled by a driver circuit external to the UART.
+SOC	System on a chip. An integrated circuit (IC) that integrates all components of a computer or other electronic system into a single chip.
+COTS	Commercial off-the-shelf or commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) is a term used to describe the purchase of packaged solutions which are then adapted to satisfy the needs of the purchasing organisation, rather than the commissioning of custom made, or bespoke, solutions. A related term, Mil-COTS, refers to COTS products for use by the U.S. military.
