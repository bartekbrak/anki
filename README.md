# Bartek Brak's anki decks

I have been acquiring knowledge from IT with unsatisfactory effect for long enough to see that learning and more importantly retaining that knowledge can't be done on without structure, thought and repetition. I plan to change my learning style and produce flashcards that will serve as backbone of my knowledge. This does not solve all problems, you can't understand a subject just from flashcards and they won't always bring back the understanding had during learning, finally not all knowledge fits into question-fact scenario, most does not. Still, let's try to create cards for everything I read and learn. 

# Format
First, I will just collect questions in any format, then I plan to have a strict format and a script to convert them to importable anki file. 

# Copyright and license
