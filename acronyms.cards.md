Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter)

> T/TCP

TCP for Transactions, extension to TCP designed to make client-server transactions faster, more efficient, and reliable, done by omitting TCP's three-way handshake at the beginning of a connection and shortening the `TIME_WAIT` state at the end of a connection.

Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions

> NFS

Network File System

A distributed file system protocol originally developed by Sun Microsystems in 1984, allowing a user on a client computer to access files over a computer network much like local storage is accessed

> BDFL

Benevolent Dictator For Life

> EAFP

Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.

> GIL

global interpreter lock

> LBYL

Look before you leap. This coding style explicitly tests for pre-conditions before making calls or lookups. This style contrasts with the EAFP approach and is characterized by the presence of many if statements.

> MRO

method resolution order

> PPTP

The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is an obsolete method for implementing virtual private networks, with many known security issues. PPTP uses a control channel over TCP and a GRE tunnel operating to encapsulate PPP packets.

> UART

Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter. A computer hardware device for asynchronous serial communication in which the data format and transmission speeds are configurable. The electric signaling levels and methods (such as differential signaling, etc.) are handled by a driver circuit external to the UART.

> SOC

System on a chip. An integrated circuit (IC) that integrates all components of a computer or other electronic system into a single chip.

> COTS

Commercial off-the-shelf or commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) is a term used to describe the purchase of packaged solutions which are then adapted to satisfy the needs of the purchasing organisation, rather than the commissioning of custom made, or bespoke, solutions. A related term, Mil-COTS, refers to COTS products for use by the U.S. military.

> SDRAM

Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory (SDRAM) is any Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) where the operation of its external pin interface is co-ordinated by an externally-supplied clock signal

> BIOS

Basic Input/Output System.

> cgroups

a Linux kernel feature that limits, accounts for, and isolates the resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, etc.) of a collection of processes.

> LXC

Linux Containers, an operating-system-level virtualization method for running multiple isolated Linux systems (containers) on a control host using a single Linux kernel.
